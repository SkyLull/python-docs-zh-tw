# Skylull: 我對 `pickle` 的命名原因進行了簡單的搜尋，只找到一則討論
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27324986/pickles-why-are-they-called-
# that
# 其中表示這名字很可能只是為了隨便找一個p開頭的單字、或原始開發人員的內部玩笑造成的約定俗成。也有人表示醃製黃瓜（pickle-
# ing）的目標就是保存和存放，所以取了這個名字。
# 無論如何似乎沒有一個定論。
# 因為不確定是否與醃漬的這個梗有關，我暫時選擇使用 `封裝` 與 `拆封` 作為譯文，大致保存那個把東西處裡後裝起來的感覺但又不至於太奇怪。
# 唯一需要擔心的是是否有與 `encapsulation` （封裝，網路協定名詞）或 `package`（封包，網路協定名詞）搞混的可能。
